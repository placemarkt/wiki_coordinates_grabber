parcat - cat files or fifos in parallel

@node SYNOPSIS
@chapter SYNOPSIS

@strong{parcat} [--rm] [-#] file(s) [-#] file(s)

@node DESCRIPTION
@chapter DESCRIPTION

GNU @strong{parcat} reads files or fifos in parallel. It writes full lines
so there will be no problem with mixed-half-lines which you risk if
you use:

@verbatim
   (cat file1 & cat file2 &) | ...
@end verbatim

Arguments can be given on the command line or passed in on stdin
(standard input).

@node OPTIONS
@chapter OPTIONS

@table @asis
@item -@strong{#}
@anchor{-@strong{#}}

Arguments following this will be sent to the file descriptor @strong{#}. E.g.

@verbatim
  parcat -1 stdout1 stdout2 -2 stderr1 stderr2
@end verbatim

will send @emph{stdout1} and @emph{stdout2} to stdout (standard output = file
descriptor 1), and send @emph{stderr1} and @emph{stderr2} to stderr (standard
error = file descriptor 2).

@item --rm
@anchor{--rm}

Remove files after opening. As soon as the files are opened, unlink
the files.

@node Simple line buffered output
@section Simple line buffered output

GNU @strong{parallel} saves output to tempfiles. If the amount of data is
bigger than the free disk space, then you can use this technique to do
line buffering without saving to disk:

@verbatim
  mkfifo slot-{1..5}
  seq 10000000 | parallel -j5 --round --pipe 'cat > slot-{%}' &
  parcat slot-{1..5} | wc
@end verbatim
