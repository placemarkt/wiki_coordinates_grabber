=head1 NAME

parset - set shell variables in parallel


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<parset> I<variablename> [options for GNU Parallel]

B<env_parset> I<variablename> [options for GNU Parallel]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<parset> is a shell function that puts the output from GNU
B<parallel> into shell variables.

B<env_parset> is a shell function that puts the output from
B<env_parallel> into shell variables.

The B<parset> and B<env_parset> functions are defined as part of
B<env_parallel>.

If I<variablename> is a single variable name, this will be treated as
the destination variable and made into an array.

If I<variablename> contains multiple names separated by ',' or space,
the names will be the destination variables. The number of names must
be at least the number of jobs - otherwise some tmp files will not be
cleaned up.


=head1 OPTIONS

Same as GNU B<parallel>, but they are put I<after> the destination
variable.


=head1 SUPPORTED SHELLS

=head2 Bash/Zsh/Ksh/Mksh

=head3 Examples

Put output into B<myarray>:

  parset myarray seq 3 ::: 4 5 6
  echo "${myarray[1]}"

Put output into vars B<$seq, $pwd, $ls>:

  parset "seq pwd ls" ::: "seq 10" pwd ls
  echo "$ls"

Put output into vars B<$seq, $pwd, $ls>:

  into_vars=(seq pwd ls)
  parset "${into_vars[*]}" ::: "seq 10" pwd ls
  echo "$ls"

The commands to run can be an array:

  cmd=("echo first" "echo '<<joe  \"double  space\"  cartoon>>'" "pwd")
  parset data ::: "${cmd[@]}"
  echo "${data[1]}"
  echo "${data[2]}"

B<parset> can read from stdin (standard input) if it is a file:

  parset res echo < parallel_input_file

but B<parset> can not be part of a pipe. In particular this means it
cannot read from a pipe or write to a pipe:

  seq 10 | parset res echo Does not work

but must instead use a tempfile:

  seq 10 > parallel_input
  parset res echo :::: parallel_input
  echo "${res[1]}"
  echo "${res[9]}"

or a FIFO:

  mkfifo input_fifo
  seq 30 > input_fifo &
  parset res echo :::: input_fifo
  echo "${res[1]}"
  echo "${res[29]}"

or Bash/Zsh/Ksh process substitution:

  parset res echo :::: <(seq 100)
  echo "${res[1]}"
  echo "${res[99]}"

=head3 Installation

Put this in the relevant B<$HOME/.bashrc> or B<$HOME/.zshenv> or B<$HOME/.kshrc>:

  . `which env_parallel.bash`
  . `which env_parallel.zsh`
  source `which env_parallel.ksh` 

E.g. by doing:

  echo '. `which env_parallel.bash`' >> $HOME/.bashrc
  echo '. `which env_parallel.zsh`' >> $HOME/.zshenv
  echo 'source `which env_parallel.ksh`' >> $HOME/.kshrc

or by doing:

  env_parallel --install


=head2 ash/dash (FreeBSD's /bin/sh)

=head3 Examples

ash does not support arrays.

Put output into vars B<$seq, $pwd, $ls>:

  parset "seq pwd ls" ::: "seq 10" pwd ls
  echo "$ls"

B<parset> can read from stdin (standard input) if it is a file:

  parset res1,res2,res3 echo < parallel_input_file

but B<parset> can not be part of a pipe. In particular this means it
cannot read from a pipe or write to a pipe:

  seq 3 | parset res1,res2,res3 echo Does not work

but must instead use a tempfile:

  seq 3 > parallel_input
  parset res1,res2,res3 echo :::: parallel_input
  echo "$res1"
  echo "$res2"
  echo "$res3"

or a FIFO:

  mkfifo input_fifo
  seq 3 > input_fifo &
  parset res1,res2,res3 echo :::: input_fifo
  echo "$res1"
  echo "$res2"
  echo "$res3"

=head3 Installation

Put the relevant one of these into B<$HOME/.profile>:

  . `which env_parallel.sh`
  . `which env_parallel.ash`
  . `which env_parallel.dash`

E.g. by doing:

  echo '. `which env_parallel.ash`' >> $HOME/.bashrc

or by doing:

  env_parallel --install


=head1 EXIT STATUS

Same as GNU B<parallel>.
