=head1 NAME

parcat - cat files or fifos in parallel

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<parcat> [--rm] [-#] file(s) [-#] file(s)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GNU B<parcat> reads files or fifos in parallel. It writes full lines
so there will be no problem with mixed-half-lines which you risk if
you use:

   (cat file1 & cat file2 &) | ...

Arguments can be given on the command line or passed in on stdin
(standard input).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 9

=item -B<#>

Arguments following this will be sent to the file descriptor B<#>. E.g.

  parcat -1 stdout1 stdout2 -2 stderr1 stderr2

will send I<stdout1> and I<stdout2> to stdout (standard output = file
descriptor 1), and send I<stderr1> and I<stderr2> to stderr (standard
error = file descriptor 2).

=item --rm

Remove files after opening. As soon as the files are opened, unlink
the files.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Simple line buffered output

GNU B<parallel> saves output to tempfiles. If the amount of data is
bigger than the free disk space, then you can use this technique to do
line buffering without saving to disk:

  mkfifo slot-{1..5}
  seq 10000000 | parallel -j5 --round --pipe 'cat > slot-{%}' &
  parcat slot-{1..5} | wc

=head1 REPORTING BUGS

GNU B<parcat> is part of GNU B<parallel>. Report bugs to
<bug-parallel@gnu.org>.
